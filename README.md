# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

## installation
* install [FiraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode)
* download and install dotfiles:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:stubbs28/dotfiles.git ${HOME}/.local/dotfiles
cd ${HOME}/.local/dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

## todo
right now the install script is only good for putting dotfiles in place. i need 
a better way of managing packages across different distros that I like to use.
